# Youtube-Data-Analysis-End-to-End-DE-Project

# Project Overview: YouTube Trending Video Analysis

This project aims to efficiently process and analyze YouTube's trending video data. Key aspects include:

1. Secure Data Management: Implement strong security for data storage and access.

2. Streamlined Processing: Develop workflows for handling structured and semi-structured video data.

3. In-depth Analysis: Examine video performance based on categories and trending metrics.

4. Data Optimization: Organize data for quick and insightful analytics.
The goal is to gain valuable insights into YouTube's trending content, understanding performance and user engagement across various categories and trending parameters. This analysis will provide a comprehensive view of content success factors on the platform.

# Project Objectives:

* Data Acquisition System:
    *  Develop a robust mechanism to collect and import data from various sources efficiently.
* Data Transformation Pipeline: 
    * Create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system to convert raw data into a structured, analysis-ready format.
* Centralized Data Repository: 
    * Implement a data lake to store diverse datasets from multiple sources in a unified location.
* Scalable Architecture: 
    * Design a flexible system capable of handling increasing data volumes without performance degradation.
* Cloud-Based Processing: 
    * Leverage AWS cloud services to process large-scale data that exceeds local computing capabilities.
* Analytics Dashboard: 
    * Construct an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights and answer critical business questions.
* These objectives aim to create a comprehensive, cloud-based data analytics platform that can efficiently process, store, and analyze large volumes of YouTube trending video data, providing valuable insights through user-friendly visualizations.



# AWS Services used:

* S3
    * Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers robust scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
* IAM
    * AWS Identity Access and Management allows for secure management of access to AWS services and resources.
* QuickSight
    * Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) service that is scalable, serverless, embeddable, and powered by machine learning.
* AWS Glue
    * AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that simplifies data preparation and integration for analytics, ML, and app development. 
    * It automates data discovery, transformation, and loading tasks without requiring server management.
* AWS Lambda
    * Amazon Lambda is a serverless compute service that automatically runs and scales code in response to events, eliminating the need for server management.
    *  It enables developers to focus on writing code while AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure provisioning and maintenance.
* AWS Athena 
    * Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that allows direct SQL-based analysis of data stored in Amazon S3 without requiring data movement or loading. 
    * It offers on-demand, pay-per-query functionality, enabling users to instantly query vast amounts of data directly from S3 using standard SQL, with no infrastructure to manage.

# Summary

1. Data is ingested from source systems in bulk and stored in the landing area of the data lake.
2. Data is processed and cleaned using AWS Glue and AWS Lambda, then stored in the cleansed/enriched area.
3. The data catalog is maintained using AWS Glue Data Catalog.
4. AWS Step Functions orchestrate the workflow of data processing.
5. Processed data is accessed via an API for analytical purposes.
6. AWS Athena and optional Redshift are used for querying the data.
7. Data is analyzed and visualized using various analytics tools like QuickSight, Qlik, etc.
8. IAM ensures secure access to all AWS services and resources. 


This architecture supports scalable, secure, and efficient data processing and analytics on the AWS cloud.
